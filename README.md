# Epicopy

Epicopy is an R package that obtains copy number variation (CNV) information from Illumina Human Methylation 450K microarrays. If the users have their own reference normal samples or decide to not use any normals for reference (see vignette after installation), Epicopy can be used as a standalone package.

If not, the users may choose to install its companion package _"EpicopyData"_ which contains a series of normal tissues compiled from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) effort. It contains normal tissues from three sources; thyroid, breast, and lung. For more information on "EpicopyData" please visit its page.
